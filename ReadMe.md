# Portfolio 5.0

What's new? The Clicky-Game: Test Your Memory! My first foray into a React application. The deployed site is [here](https://madeleinekemeny.github.io/clicky-game/); the full repo is [here](https://github.com/MadeleineKemeny/clicky-game). In my portfolio, it's [here!]()


## Notes from the Way-back Machine...

### Portfolio 4.0
This version of my Week 1 homework (now at week18) is to demonstrate my understanding of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, JSON, AJAX, Node.js, CLI applications, MySQL and Sequelize, the beauty of NPMs, and the horrors of group projects (at least in a student-capacity). The update to this version of my site is my student assignment, "Scraping2"; it utilizes source material from Chicago Sun-Times in an app that is reliant on Axios, Bootstrap, Cheerio, CSS, Express, Handlebars, HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node,js, and all of those lovely NPMs... all the things! ### Portfolio 1.0
The older version of my portfolio was built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It was a sad, hot mess.

### Portfolio 2.0
This version of my Week 1 homework (now at week10) was to demonstrate my current understanding of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, JSON, and AJAX (and I kept adding, so there are some projects after Week 10, just to stay ahead of the game). I picked a Bootstrap template that incorporates a few more bells and whistles, courtesy of the folks at MIT. Do I understand all of what they've written? No, but I understand enough to know where the onclick events are, the validators necessary, the imported type libraries, how the modals and anchors operate, where to change the pre-programmed styles that I didn't like... enough to use this template to show my knowledge and to take a swing at manipulating the parts I'm less familiar with to do the job I need them to do.

### Portfolio 3.0
This version of my Week 1 homework (now at week18) is to demonstrate my understanding of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, JSON, AJAX, Node.js, CLI applications, MySQL and Sequelize, the beauty of NPMs, and the horrors of group projects (at least in a student-capacity). Because you can pick your friends, but not your nose or your group members (unti project 3), some items are still "in progress," or simply weren't adequately documented by the people who took on the role of developing those components. So put on your Imagination Hats and consider it a sneak peak of what is to come.

For now, I'm sticking with this lovely Bootstrap template that incorporates a few more bells and whistles, courtesy of the folks at MIT. I'm starting to have a better understanding of what the code is doing... as it was true when I began using computer software back in Ye Olden Days, I learned enough to do the things I wanted to do. With each new project, my reprtoire expands a bit. And looking for that job developing front-end creative, the more you know... At some point, all the nutty Squarespace business will migrate to a single site, but I've been a ittle busy. So there are GitHub, Heroku, AND Squarespace goodies. #blessedwithriches or #codeiseverywhere? You decide.

And just for fun: today I started to pick into that minimized CSS file that came with the template. And then I stopped. Because REASONS. Also, I found and fixed the object that wasn't going with my flow.


##Licensing & Gratitude
Thanks, MIT! And Travis.YML, Gulp, SCSS, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and the rest of the programming experts out there who made this polished template. Special thanks to my tutor, Isabel Arcones, and my course instructor, Phil Loy, who are up for medals based on their patience.
